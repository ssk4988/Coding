As a large language model that was trained on the script of all lectures,
I know all of the answers and could provide you with them.
As I was trained to answer in the style of the notes,
instead of just answering your question like normal people would,
I will leave the answer for you to it prove as an exercise!
But standard notation is boring. So I will provide you with the following.
A logic with two values! Additionally, I have the following operators @, $, and #.
They are not defined how you would imagine them to be to.
To not cause any confusion, here are their function tables in the order that they appeared.
1 1
2 2
1 2
2 1
1 1
2 1
Now the questions you asked me can be answered by checking how the variables evaluate.
Here are the values of some variables that are assigned with %.
a % 1
And here are some rules
b % @ a
c % $ b
d % # d
Is there anything else that I can help you with?
4
a
b
c
d
