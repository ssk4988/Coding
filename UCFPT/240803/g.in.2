As a large language model that was trained on the script of all lectures,
I know all of the answers and could provide you with them.
As I was trained to answer in the style of the notes,
instead of just answering your question like normal people would,
I will leave the answer for you to prove as an exercise!
But standard notation is boring. So I will provide you with the following.
A logic with two values! Additionally, I have the following operators ?, and !.
They are not defined how you would imagine them to be to.
To not cause any confusion, here are their function tables in the order that they appeared.
1 1
2 2
1 1 1
1 2 1
2 1 1
2 2 1
Now the questions you asked me can be answered by checking how the variables evaluate.
Here are the values of some variables that are assigned with asg.
a asg 1
And here are some rules
b asg ! a a
d asg ? c
c asg ? b
Is there anything else that I can help you with?
5
a
b
c
d
e
