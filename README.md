# About
This is a repository for all of my competitive programming solutions and related files. The majority of solutions are in C++, but there are some Java soltuions and even fewer Python solutions.

## Sections

#### CodeForces
These are my CodeForces solutions, mostly organized by the round they were done in. There is also a practice folder with random, unorganized problems that I decided to do.

#### CSES
These are my solutions to the [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) Problems. I've currently solve 289/300 problems, putting me in the top 100 solvers on CSES.

#### UCFPT
These are solutions I have written related to UCF Programming Team practices and ICPC contests.
